# 1 when filming, have enough space above your head to place headlines and running captions
The idea is to minimize distraction.
# 2 create and display a headline in every single video
The headline should be "text on screen" and exist in the video for a minimum of 3 seconds.
# 3 provide running captions in every single video
This provides options for people who want to watch your video but are unable to listen to it. This also adds more stimuli to videos, which helps to better maintain people's attention.
# 4 refrain from having a distracting background
This is part of [[#1 when filming, have enough space above your head to place headlines and running captions|number 1]], to create space for your headlines and captions and reduce the attention being pulled from them toward the background.
# 5 pay attention to your clip-to-content ratio
"This is how many clips it takes you to film your videos." Or, perhaps, a better way to put it is how many clips are included in your final video. The more clips and different angles you can incorporate into your content, the more visually interesting, the more stimulating your video will be.

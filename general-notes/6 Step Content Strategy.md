# 1 build your vision
- What is the big scary end goal of content creation? (ie start a business, podcast, become a full-time creator, etc)
- What is your "why"?
	"why" in content creation shouldn't be about you. It's not very compelling to say "I'm doing this because I want these platforms to pay me." No, why would anyone want to stop scrolling and watch your video?
# 2 build your brand
"Your brand as a content creator is not what you talk about, it's how you talk about it."
This is your unique selling propositions. This should address:
- Who do you want in your community?
- What problems do you want to solve for your audience?
- What's different about you than other people who do the same thing?
# 3 build your content pillars
What are three topics or buckets of content you can create? These are things you can talk with your audience that will help you achieve your "why."
# 4 build your posting schedule
This is execution. Quality over quantity.
- How many times per week is sustainable and achievable?
# 5 build your content library
Develop ideas to run content as
- Series
- Inward focus ("Here's how I wrote my first short story")
- Outward focus ("Here's how you can write your first short story")
- Style
# 6 reframe your mindset
- Dismantle limiting beliefs and the scarcity mindset
- Dropping the victim mindset in favor of solutions
- Unlearn the stories you're telling yourself
- Redefine success in terms of achieving your "why"

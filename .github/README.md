I'm doing a "30 Days of Learning Content Marketing" where I throw myself into 
a sort of crash course in learning how to do this shit. This repo will grow 
into a content strategy developmental template as I learn what is necessary to 
create the damn thing.  
  
I'll be including notes and links I use throughout this journey, and parking 
the different levels of progress in different branches, so no matter when you 
drop in to this series, you can follow along by selecting the appropriate 
branch. 
  
I'll be posting the relevant content on these pages (titles are links):
  
## [Instagram Reels][nonsenseig] & [Tiktok][nonsensetiktok]

This is where the main videos will be posted daily. While I will attempt to 
produce different content for each platform, they'll both pretty much have the 
same information, so pick your fav and find me there.

## [YouTube][nonsenseyoutube]

I'll be sharing videos on YouTube somewhat sparingly, mostly as longer 
companion/tutorial videos to those posted on IG/Tiktok. So don't expect much 
here, but be prepared to spend a little time as these will be longer and more 
involved than those elsewhere. Videos specifically pertaining to working with 
the Obsidian template listed below will be posted to:

<br />

YouTube channel. Hell, actually, I may just 
post everything to LVNACY. But I'm not sure yet. Maybe some things won't make 
sense to post there. I'll be specific about where you can find what when I 
post.

## [Bluesky][nonsensebluesky] & [Threads][nonsensethreads]

These will be more for announcements and discussions around the videos, but 
I'll also share links and resources as far as this project is concerned. 
Similarly to IG/Tiktok, I'll be crafting slightly different for each platform 
but will be providing more or less the same information.

This repository works best as a submodule for [Obsidian][obsidian]. While you 
absolutely can follow along without plugging this in to an Obsidian vault, 
you'll get the most out of the links and tables if you do use Obsidian. I have 
created a template vault that includes the plugins you will need to make this 
work right out of the box:
  
[x L V N A C Y x | Obsidian Vault Template](https://github.com/ephemeralrogue/obsidian-vault-template)
  
Simply activate the "Use this template" button, give your new repository a 
name, and then clone your new repo where you intend to setup your new vault. 
Then open Obsidian and select "Open Folder as Vault." Once your template vault 
is setup, navigate to the directory in your terminal and add this library as a 
submodule. You can find information on using git submodules 
[here][submodules].  

I also recommend plugging in the [Marketing Library][marketlib], as much of 
the content I will consuming, takes notes, and analyzing will make a 
permanent home there. This step is entirely optional, but recommended.
  
Don't want to do all that? No problem: each day, you can navigate to that 
day's branch and download the zip. Unpack the zip in your vault's directory 
and allow your file explorer to overwrite any existing files. I'll probably 
end up posting a YouTube video about this whole thing, but that will be later, 
once I've figured out how to do so.

If you're like me and you need a swift kick in the pants to get up and do 
something, consider this that. You didn't stumble on this by accident. This 
isn't a *For You* page, you're not scrolling; this is *intentional*. Go forth 
and build something with this. Follow along. Reach out with questions on the 
platforms listed above. I will do my best to keep up with comments and DMs, so 
long as they're respectful.

Happy creating!
